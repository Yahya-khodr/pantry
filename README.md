Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the PantryPal app uses:

- This project uses as frontend the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For the backend the app uses the [Django web development framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
